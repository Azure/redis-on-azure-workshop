# RedisJSON in Azure Cache for Redis

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file and data interchange format. If you've worked with any modern web application or API, you've probably used JSON.

JSON is supported by most programming languages, and typically native objects and arrays are encoded as JSON (serialized), before being sent over the network or written to a file. Parsing JSON, or deserialization, is the opposite of this process.

Storing JSON in Azure Cache for Redis let's you work with JSON values directly, without the need for multiple operations to retrieve, update or access values within the data. When working with JSON in your cache, there's no need to serialize and deserialize data.

The RedisJSON module provides JSON support for Redis. RedisJSON lets you store, update, and retrieve JSON values in a Redis database, similar to any other Redis data type.

Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise includes RedisJSON. Once enabled, your cache becomes a powerful, superfast in-memory JSON document store.
